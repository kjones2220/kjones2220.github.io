                NOTE
                Notice that the href="index.html", which is this file.

                This means that when users click this link, they will be directed
                to the same page they're already on.

                Sounds silly right? We have this defined here so that when we reuse
                this navbar code on "otherpage.html", we will have a link back to
                the home page again.

                Why can't we just define it there and not here? Having consistent
                navbars and footers on your website creates a better user-experience
                for those browsing your site.

                  NOTE
                  Previously, we defined links that lead to URLs on the internet.

                  Here's an example of how we can define URLs to local pages, other
                  pages of our website. The way to structure these links is similar
                  to how we define paths for css href="./mycssfilename.css" or
                  "mycssfilename.css", and images src="./imgs/myimagename.jpg"

                  We simply make another filename.html, and link it here.

                  (These links all lead to the same page out of convenience)

              I am the 90's lovin', hip-hop playing, pop culture obsessed consumer insights analyst with a side hustle of graphic design. If you ask me Biggie or Tupac, I'll say Biggie in a heartbeat. If you ask Photoshop or Illustrator, expect to hear the one and only correct answer –– Illustrator.

              I'm a senior Marketing and Communication double major with a passion for... you probably thought I'd say fashion in reference to Sasha from Bratz. But, my passion is for everything that exudes spunk. I love understanding people, why they do what they do, and how to best appeal to them. So, it makes sense that consumer insights is for me.

              I've been in love with the media and entertainment industry for so long that I can't tell if my passion for it started first or if it was my performance as Scary Spice from the Spice Girls in the talent show. With graphic design, you take in all of the details about your target audience –– or maybe just your friend who wants a snapchat filter for their birthday –– and you bring their vision to life. You listen and then you deliver. That's what it's all about.
